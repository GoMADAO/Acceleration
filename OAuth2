How does OAuth2 work?

OAuth2 provide 3party authentication to some resource like Google, Linkedin and etc.

4 roles
Resource owner -> user
Client -> app created by us
Resource server -> 3 party resource server
Authentication server -> 3 party authentication server


Workflow
1. app -> user: ask user to grant certain permission
2. user (with their input) -> authentication server: user login to 3 party
3. user grant app permission
4. app receives user authorization code
5. app exchange authorization code to get access token with app's client id/ client secret
6. auth server grant permission to app and return access token
7. app use access token to call resource server
