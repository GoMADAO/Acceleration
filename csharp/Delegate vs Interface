Performance
Delegate is faster to execute
Interface is faster to get

Example code:
Action action = SomeMethod;

Delegates are reference types that contain both instance and the pointer to a method. By referencing type, it needs allocate memory.

Example code:
IRunnable runnable = this;

Since the actual oject implements the interface, there is no new instance. This means no memory allocated.
