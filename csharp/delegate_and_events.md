# Delegate
- **What is delegate?**

> A bit like an interface with single method. (Signature of a method/ a pointer to a function)

> Hold a reference to a method and the target object the method should be called on


 <!--- Need blank line before this line (and the .. line above).
 HTML comment written with 3 dashes so that Pandoc suppresses it.
 Blank lines may appear anywhere in the comment.

 All non-blank lines must be indented at least one space.
 HTML comment close must be followed by a blank line and a line
 that is not indented at all (if necessary that can be a line
 with just two periods followed by another blank line).
